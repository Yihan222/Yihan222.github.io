## About Me {#sec} 

I'm a first-year PhD student from [CSE](https://cse.nd.edu/graduate/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Meng Jiang](http://www.meng-jiang.com/) and working in [DM2: Data Mining towards Decision Making lab](http://www.meng-jiang.com/lab.html). My current research focuses on AI for Science, especially graph learning for polymer prediction & generation.

## Experience {#sec} 

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
